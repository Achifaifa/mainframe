Readme - Achifaifa's mainframe code
 
Repo for mainframe related code and files, including:
  
  -Configuration files
  -Custom screens and datasets/members
  -JCL
  -COBOL programs
  -Other scripts that could come handy
  

    
Please note that (AFAIK) you can't run git on z/OS and upload code from there. All code has been copypasted to a plain text file from working datasets and could contain typos, mistakes or non-working fragments of code. 

Don't run anything in this repo without understanding what it does first and how it does it (That is the whole point), and double-check for mistakes and things you should modify in the program to make it work (parameters, names, members, devices, etc)
