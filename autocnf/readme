 Auto CNF creator (WIP)
 
 This python script automatically installs and configures hercules.
 
 
TO-DO list:
 
  -implement getram()
    getram gets the available system memory
  -implement getpath()
    getpath looks for the z/OS files and saves the path to the folder, to be dumped later in the cnf file
  -allow multi-distro installation
    I don't even
  -implement create()
    creates the actual file
  -write a decent help section

Notes/bugs/stuff that doesn't work: 

-getzone() gets the timezone, but only in a n or -n format (n being hours) instead of the +hhmm / -hhmm format required by Hercules.
-cpu_count theoretically returns the numbers of CPUs in the system, but I can't test this.
-the help lines are outdated and useless. Ignore the help menu.
-only the first option in the menu and the exit one (0) are functional
